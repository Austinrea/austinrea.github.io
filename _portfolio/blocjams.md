### Summary 


The ability to access your music wherever you are is important to many people and with the increased trend of shifting our access to music from physical products to software based services, I present to you - Bloc Jams.

Bloc Jams is the online music streaming service in which you can store all of your own music and access it anytime, anywhere.

### Explanation

The reason for building Bloc Jams was to gain knowledge in building a web application from the ground up.  As I am still learning Web Development, it is important to go through, in detail, each stage involved in building such a service and get hands-on experience implementing all the new skills I am learning in a real working model.

### Problem

Throughout the Bloc Jams project there were problems that occurred regarding the use of my new skills and my coding ability.  The learning curve was very steep and putting it all together was a tricky balancing act of learning new languages, writing a lot of new code each day, de-bugging any incorrect code as well as putting my own individual design style into the project.

### Solution

Learning to code is a process which I have recently started and will be learning for a long time yet.  In order to continue the process, I regularly complete coding challenges on the Codewars website and research new and more efficient ways to code certain problems.

Whilst building the Bloc Jams project, I had continual support from my mentor.  He was there to aid my progress and help me de-bug my code when I couldn’t see where the problems stemmed from.  Whilst he didn’t always give me solutions, he really encouraged me to solve the problems for myself as a real developer.  Additionally he said it was ok to reach out for help when I didn't fully understand something.

### Conclusion

After finishing the project I can honestly say that I learned a lot.  Sometimes it was rather overwhelming with the sheer amount of new things I had to learn and utilise but I also enjoyed the whole process and found it very interesting.

I think it was a good experience not only to learn new skills but to continually put them into practice.

Whilst I wouldn’t have done anything differently, I would have liked more time to be able to research some of the topics in more detail to gain a fuller understanding.

After using my new skills daily, I have more confidence moving forward and in my ability to code and implement ideas in a more timely fashion.
