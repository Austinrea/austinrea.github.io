I am going to start off by saying that it has been a pretty rapid and intense ride so far... but a good one.

When trying to research a subject that you are interested in, but don't know a huge amount about, it's difficult to know where to start and also how deep the rabbit-hole is going to go.

Web Development is really interesting to me and I have enjoyed what I have learnt so far but I am also aware that I have only scratched the surface and have a long way to go.  I guess it's the kind of thing you never stop learning.  Whilst this kind of scares me a little it also keeps my interest up.  When you reach that carrot you’ve been working towards where do you go next?

There is something comforting about continual learning.  If you don't know how to do something, you know that in time it will come and that in itself is pretty exciting.

My main difficulty so far has been time.  As I mentioned in another post, the course at Bloc is intense and it takes up a lot of your time.  Whilst I am studying almost full-time, I am also trying to keep down a job so that I can have money coming in as I study.

A lot of the tasks are very time consuming.  This can be quite stressful when you have limited time, are trying to lean a new skill and also need to complete your weekly assignments.  On top of that, I am a bit of a perfectionist and would like to spend more time on each assignment to be able to fully understand it and work on it to the best of my ability.

I guess another of my main challenges in learning to become a Web Developer is my age.  On one hand I don’t think it matters how old you are in learning something new but I certainly feel that I would have been quicker and more adept at picking certain things up had I studied this subject several years ago.  I do not regret the path I have chosen through life though and I am very happy to be studying this now.

Onwards and upwards as they say…
