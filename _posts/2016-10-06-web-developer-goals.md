title: My goals as a Web Developer

When I first started thinking about becoming a Web Developer I grew very excited at the prospects of being able to work on my own projects and build things that I had only ever dreamed of.&nbsp;  I often thought about ideas that would enhance the user-experience on websites but I didn’t know how to turn them into reality.

I had had an interest in this subject from a young age when I had first started learning C at school and at the beginning of 2016 I finally decided to quit my job and concentrate on studying Web Development full-time.

I knew that learning to become a Web Developer wouldn’t be an easy road to walk but I hoped it would be an interesting one with lots of possibilities and my main goal to ultimately find a fulfilling career.

In the short-term my goals are to learn as much as I can about the full process of Web Development and to concentrate on learning Javascript as a main language.&nbsp;  I know that there are many different programming languages, all with their own unique uses and characteristics, but I would like to have one language as my main go-to skill and then develop further skills from there.&nbsp;  Javascript is very challenging at the moment and I find myself toiling over problems for long periods of time however, each and every task I complete I become quicker and more confident in my abilities to overcome challenges using my newly acquired skills.

My long-term goal is to be able to secure an interesting and fulfilling career hopefully with a mid-large tech company as a junior Web Developer.&nbsp;  I like working as part of a team but also like to see where my input is going and how I play a part in the bigger picture.

Hopefully in time I will become a successful Web Developer and be able to use my skills to build some interesting and stylish projects.
