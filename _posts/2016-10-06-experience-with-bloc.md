After quitting my job and deciding to study Web Development I then had to enroll on a course.&nbsp;  Nowadays there are numerous ways of learning how to code, ranging from online schools with full or part-time courses to intensive in-person boot camps that last anywhere from a few weeks to a few months.&nbsp;  After some research I found an online school that fitted my requirements and was closer to my budget than the competitors.&nbsp;  That’s when I joined [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io/about)!

>Bloc is an online education company with intensive mentor-led programs for aspiring developers and designers.

>Bloc relies on the time-tested apprenticeship model, combining experienced mentors and industry-vetted curriculum to offer students around the world a more accessible and effective alternative to an offline coding boot camp or traditional computer science degree.

At the time of writing this post I am currently 6 weeks into a 27-week course and so far it has been interesting, challenging, stressful, rewarding, fun and time-consuming...

It is also quite early days for me to be writing a full review of this school and the course but to begin with I will tell you that prior to starting this course I had very limited, as well as dated, training on this subject and the industry.

Although I had studied some programming at school as well as at University, it was a long time ago and not really a comprehensive learning experience.&nbsp;  We covered some of the basics of Web Development but not much more and as you can imagine, times change very quickly regarding technology.

Bloc has taken me from a complete novice and already given me a good understanding of the Web Development process and hopefully a good foundation to becoming a good Web Developer.&nbsp;  I can’t even begin to list all the material we have covered so far and it has been pretty intense and difficult at times but I do feel that everything is coming together now.

Each day I spend a few hours working on my checkpoints and projects and twice a week I meet with my mentor online.&nbsp;  The checkpoints are where we work through some exercises and put into practice the things that we are learning.&nbsp;  At the end of the checkpoint we complete an assignment where we use the skills we’ve newly learnt to complete a set task.&nbsp;  To date the checkpoints all seem to add up to create each small project.

While the course is not designed to be completed at your own pace you can study in your own time as long as you keep on top of weekly goals set out by the curriculum.

As mentioned, I meet with my mentor twice a week.&nbsp;  This is when I can ask questions or work on problems or even go over mistakes from past exercises.&nbsp;  He is pretty experienced and always helps me out when I need it and continually encourages my progress.

I will keep this blog updated as to my progress and will continue to evaluate how I am getting on at Bloc.
